# Team Poaching Game

A multiplayer FastAPI-based game where students can join, create teams, poach players from other teams, and leave teams to become free agents. Features a full admin panel for game management with configurable team sizes.

üöÄ **Live Demo:** https://poachers.vercel.app  
üîê **Admin Panel:** https://poachers.vercel.app/admin (password: `Douglas42`)

## Game Rules

- Teams have a configurable maximum size (default: 2 members, adjustable in admin panel)
- Player names must be unique
- Team names must be unique
- Players can only poach if their team has space available
- You cannot poach from your own team
- Players can leave their team to become free agents
- Teams are automatically dissolved when they have no members

## Quick Start

The easiest way to use the API is via the live deployment:

**API Base URL:** https://poachers.vercel.app

No setup required! Jump directly to the [Example Game Flow](#example-game-flow) section.

## Local Development Setup

## Example Game Flow

**Using the live API (https://poachers.vercel.app):**

1. **Players join:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/join -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"player_name": "Alice"}'
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/join -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"player_name": "Bob"}'
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/join -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"player_name": "Charlie"}'
   ```

2. **Create teams:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/team -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action": "create", "team_name": "TeamAlpha", "creator_name": "Alice"}'
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/team -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action": "join", "team_name": "TeamAlpha", "player_name": "Bob"}'
   ```

3. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   curl https://poachers.vercel.app/status
   ```

4. **Poach players:**
   ```bash
   # Charlie creates a new team first
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/team -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action": "create", "team_name": "TeamBeta", "creator_name": "Charlie"}'

   # Now Charlie can poach Bob from TeamAlpha
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/poach -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"target_player_name": "Bob", "poacher_team_name": "TeamBeta"}'
   ```

5. **Leave a team:**
   ```bash
   # Alice leaves TeamAlpha (team will be dissolved since she's the only member)
   curl -X POST https://poachers.vercel.app/leave -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"player_name": "Alice"}'
   ```

**For local development, replace `https://poachers.vercel.app` with `http://localhost:8002`**

## Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or game rule violations
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors

Example error response:
```json
{
  "detail": "Player with name 'Alice' already exists"
}
```

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework for building APIs
- **Turso** - Distributed SQLite database for persistent storage
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization
- **Mangum** - ASGI adapter for serverless deployment
- **itsdangerous** - Cryptographically signed session tokens
- **python-multipart** - Form data handling
- **uv** - Fast Python package and project manager
- **Vercel** - Serverless deployment platform

## Database

This game uses [Turso](https://turso.tech/) - a distributed SQLite database for persistent data storage across serverless deployments.

### Setting Up Your Own Database

1. **Create Turso database:**
   ```bash
   # Install Turso CLI
   curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | sh

   # Create database
   turso db create poachers

   # Get connection URL and auth token
   turso db show poachers --url
   turso db tokens create poachers
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # For local development
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Turso credentials:
   # TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database-url
   # TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
   ```

3. **For Vercel deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables in Vercel
   vercel env add TURSO_DATABASE_URL
   vercel env add TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

The database schema is automatically initialized on first connection. Tables created:
- `players` - Player information
- `teams` - Team information  
- `team_members` - Team membership relationships
- `game_stats` - Game statistics (includes configurable max team size setting)

## Deployment

The game is deployed on Vercel at https://poachers.vercel.app

To deploy your own instance:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy (will prompt for configuration)
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Make sure to set up the Turso environment variables in your Vercel project settings.
